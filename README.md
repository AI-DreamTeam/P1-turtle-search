# Turtle Search
This is the first practice for our AI class, and its objective is to implement the [iterative deepening depth-first search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_depth-first_search)
to help a turtle (from Python's [turtle library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html)) find the exit for a labyrinth.
